Hello, I'm Jakob Griffith (Kobaj), and this is my attempt to make a complete game for Android based devices within 14 days.

Status: Complete. (See details below.)

UPDATE: Looking at using the source code in your own game? Check of <a href='http://code.google.com/p/foxdashtwo'>Fox Dash 2!</a> Currently still in development, Fox Dash 2 offers easier to read code with better organization and comments. Not to mention it has new features (such as particles) and is built on OpenGL instead of Canvas, what a boost to FPS!

Fox Dash is a casual side scroll style video game written in Java for the Android platform. It took 16 days to complete (a little longer than the original plan). But overall is a success and has been released mostly open source.

Custom code/engine from scratch,
Custom art assets too!

Music by Andrew Riley.
Sound by Kevin Poisson.
Title Screen by Raymond Griffith.

And for the sake of time XML handling is done with Simple XML.

NOTE: RunFoxRun is the development codename. Fox Dash is the released games name.
