The original Fox Dash game, as stated in the Proposal took 14-16 days to complete. Completion concluded with uploading and submitting a fully functional .apk (executable) to the Android Market.

This .apk contained all specifications from the Proposal, including game play, art, sound, music, etc. It is, a complete and simple game. Anyone who wishes to play this .apk can find it in the download section.

I am not one to let such a project stagnate though.

New bugs are found each day, and new features seek to be implemented. Thus I will continue development on Fox Dash with updates to any and all aspects of the game. Anyone who wishes to play the latest version of the .apk can find it on the Android Market.
